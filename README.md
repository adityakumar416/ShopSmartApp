Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary programming language for the app, leveraging its concise syntax and safety features.

Jetpack Navigation Component: For managing app navigation, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly flow throughout the app.

ViewModel and LiveData: For managing UI-related data lifecycle consciously and reacting to data changes asynchronously.

Firebase Firestore: Used as the primary database for storing user and product data. Firestoreâ€™s real-time syncing ensures that all user actions (like adding to the cart or wishlist) are updated instantly.

Glide: For loading images efficiently into the app, providing smooth scrolling and optimized memory usage.

RecyclerView and Adapters: Utilized for creating dynamic lists such as product listings, wishlists, and order history. Custom adapters have been implemented to handle complex data sets and interactions.

Retrofit: For network operations, particularly for fetching weather data and other required APIs, ensuring robust and efficient communication with external services.

Shared Preferences: For managing small, simple key-value pairs, particularly useful for storing user login status and preferences locally on the device.
